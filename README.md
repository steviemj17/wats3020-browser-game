# WATS 3020 Browser Game Project

This project is designed to practice event handling in the context of a modern
JavaScript web application.

To complete this project, you will build a working Tic Tac Toe game. Some pieces
have been provided for you in order to allow you to focus on the events, event
listeners, and the way logic is executed in response to system events.

**Note:** In this game you have been given the Bootstrap framework to use. This
includes jQuery as a dependency. You are free to use Bootstrap CSS components as
much as you wish (grid, buttons, etc.), but avoid using jQuery or Bootstrap
JavaScript components when completing the Basic Requirements.

## Some Notes on Architecture

This is the most complex of all of our project so far. But if we break it down
to the basic functions, we can see that this project is really made up of a few
straightforward pieces.

The primary component of this game is the `TicTacToe` class. This class handles
all of the game mechanics, controls the game board, and generally provides most
of the logic for our page. The `TicTacToe` class has `player1` and `player2`
properties, which refer to `Player` class objects. These two classes make up
the entire logic of the game itself.

Outside of the class structure, there are a few event listeners to watch for
game-wide events. The first listener looks for the [DOMContentLoaded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/DOMContentLoaded) event,
which tells the program that it's safe to run the game. The other listeners
are watching for `win` and `draw` events in order to provide a game end screen.

Finally, there is a `handleMove()` function that is used by the listeners we
apply to the game tiles. This function calls a set of methods on the `TicTacToe`
class instance. These are the steps to process each individual player move.

Note that the logic included outside of the class structures is simple and
refers to the "interface" we've created through our design of the classes. Also
note that we use multiple event listeners to respond to different things that
happen throughout the game. This is an event-driven architecture, meaning that
the event signals are what make each part of the game happen. Without them, our
game would never "do" anything.

### Game Logic

This version of Tic Tac Toe follows a turn-taking pattern that involves just a
few steps for each turn. Here is the logical flow of the game.

1. Player clicks "Start Game" button. 
2. Game board is initialized, game state is initialized.
3. First player is prompted to make a move.
4. Player selects a tile to claim.
5. Player's move is saved in the game state.
6. Player's move is analyzed to see if it "wins" the game.
7. If the player's move is a winning move, then the game ends by showing the "win" screen.
8. If the player's move is not a winning move, the game checks to see if there are any more moves left (since the game has only 9 tiles to claim, there can only be 9 moves in a game).
9. If there are no more possible moves (meaning 9 moves have been completed), then the game ends by showing the "draw" screen.
10. If there are still some possible moves (meaning fewer than 9 moves have been completed), then the game switches players.
11. The next player is prompted to move, and the logic in steps 5 thru 10 is repeated.  

*Note:* When you're provided a list of logical steps as you see above it can be useful to draw a flow chart.  You can do this on paper. It can help you when you are debugging the application to see if your code is going where you expect when you run it.  You can also label the methods or functions that implement the steps.  This is not required, but you can turn in an image of your flow chart as a stretch goal. Here's a link to some [Tic Tac Toe flowcharts](https://www.google.com/search?q=tic+tac+toe+flow+chart&tbm=isch), but the rules they are describing may not be the same as the rules above, so make your flowchart specific to the rules above.   

These steps are translated almost directly into class methods and functions that are triggered by event listeners in the code. There is very little data stored about the game, since the only data that is needed to determine the win state is what tiles each player has claimed. 

The claimed tile data is stored in an array that contains three arrays. At the beginning of the game, the value of this array is initialized to:

```
this.gameState = [
   [null, null, null],
   [null, null, null],
   [null, null, null]
];
```
This allows us to access the data about each tile using (X, Y) coordinates:

```
// Tile data can be accessed using X, Y coordinates:
this.gameState[x][y];

// The top left tile would be:
this.gameState[0][0];

// The middle tile would be:
this.gameState[1][1];
```
You are provided with a function that evaluates each move to see if it constitutes a win. This is accomplished by storing an array of all possible winning Tic Tac Toe combinations for a 3x3 board. This data looks like:

```
this.winStates = [
    [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2]],
    [[1,0],[1,1],[1,2]],
    [[2,0],[2,1],[2,2]],
    [[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]],
    [[0,1],[1,1],[2,1]],
    [[0,2],[1,2],[2,2]],
    [[0,0],[1,1],[2,2]],
    [[0,2],[1,1],[2,0]]
];
```
This is also an array of arrays, but each array here contains three coordinates. The first array is the winning condition when a player has claimed all tiles in the top row. The next array is the condition when a player has claimed all tiles in the middle row. These coordinates are used to check against the `this.gameState` object to determine whether or not a player has won.

### Important Game Events

The **DOMContentLoaded** event kicks everything off. It causes the game to be initialized and begin.

The **win** event denotes a winning state for one player. It causes the game to end by showing the "win screen".

The **draw** event denotes a draw state for the game: No player can win. It causes the game to end by showing the "draw screen".

The **click** event on a **tile** object causes a player's move to be handled by the game logic (see the list of logic steps above for details about what happens during that process).

## Basic Requirements

In order to complete this project you will need to fulfill these requirements:

* Create a `Player` class that accepts an `icon` parameter in the `constructor()`.
* Complete the creation of a `TicTacToe` class to handle the primary game functions.
    * Set up the game board using DOM manipulation commands.
    * Initialize values to count moves and track game status (playing, won, draw).
    * Add event listeners to game tiles to handle player interaction.
    * Create methods to handle game logic including recording moves, switching
      players, etc.
* Allow the player to begin a game by clicking the "Start Game" button.
* Add event listeners to the `document` object to handle "win" and "draw" events.

## Stretch Goals

If you complete the requirements above, try these stretch goals to make the
project more interesting and personal. (Feel free to use Bootstrap or jQuery
JavaScript components to make these stretch goals more interesting if you
prefer.)

* Create a flowchart for the logic you implement. 
* Re-style the game so it fits your design concept.
* Currently, when the user clicks "Play again", the game reloads the HTML page
  reset itself. It would be better if the game were reset using JavaScript.
  Create an event listener that would respond to the "play again" button click
  event to reset and restart the game using only JavaScript commands (so the browser does
  not need to reload the page).
* Create a "call draw" button that shows during each player's turn. If the
  players realize the game is going to be a draw, they can click the button to
  call the game as a draw and start a new one.
* Create a "coin flip" feature that randomly determines which player will start
  each game.
* **Advanced** Enhance the logic in the `checkForWinner()` method to determine if there are
  no possible winning moves. If not, call the game as a draw (without the need
  for the players to click a "call draw" button).
* **Advanced** Add a player profile form that can collect information from the
  player to customize the game. They could enter a `name` and select an `icon`
  preference from existing Glyphicons (already included and used in the game).
